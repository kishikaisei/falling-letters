# Falling Letters
To run the game, it needs to be hosted in a web server, and just run localhost:port

# Concept
The idea of the game is a typing game where you need to type any of the falling letters to try to make a high score, where the golden letters are more valuable than the silver ones.

# Technology
This game depends on phaser, the HTML5 game framework, I chose this framework so it helps with the basic set up, handling key input, and animations.

# TODO
- Juicing

# Done
- scoring system
- input to destroy the letters
- falling letters
- goldem letters have 10% chance of appearing
- destroying the letters when they exit the screen
- start to start the game
